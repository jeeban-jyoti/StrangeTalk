# Strange Talk

## Overview
Strange Talk is an Android application designed to connect users randomly for text-based conversations, similar to the concept of Omegle. At its current stage, the app only supports text chat functionality. However, future updates aim to incorporate video chat capabilities, as well as a feature called "Cred" for known users to connect using unique codes.

## Features
- **Random Chat**: Users are connected randomly to other users for text-based conversations.
- **Cred Section** (Unbuilt): This feature will allow known users to connect with each other using specific codes.
- **Video Chat** (Unbuilt): Future updates will include video chat functionality using WebRTC technology.

## Technologies Used
- **React Native**: The application is built using React Native framework for seamless Android experience.
- **Socket.IO**: Socket.IO is utilized for real-time communication between users in the chat feature.
- **WebRTC**: WebRTC will be implemented for the upcoming video chat feature, enabling peer-to-peer communication.
